# polskiNotation
Introducing the revolutionary "polishNotation" text processor! In a valiant effort to catapult readability into the stratosphere, this state-of-the-art Python script transforms mundane Polish text into a masterpiece of categorization. Ever found yourself reading and wondering, "Is this word a verb, a noun, or just an existential quandary in disguise?" Worry no more!

Our script deftly slaps a crystal-clear prefix onto each word, so you're never in doubt. "r" heralds the noble noun (rzeczownik), standing tall like knights of old. The dynamic "c" swoops in before each verb (czasownik), leaping off the page with action-packed zest. And for everything else that defies classification, the enigmatic "i" offers a nod of acknowledgement.

But why stop at Polish? We dream of a world where every word in every language carries its grammatical purpose on its sleeve. Imagine English sentences prancing about with "n" for nouns, "v" for verbs, and maybe "huh" for those words that leave us scratching our heads.

In this brave new world, sentences will no longer be mere strings of words. They will be parades of purpose, each word marching to the beat of its grammatical role. Poetry will become a dance of labels, and prose a symphony of clarity.

So, embrace the future with "polishNotation" â€“ because why simply read, when you can read and decode the very essence of language itself?
